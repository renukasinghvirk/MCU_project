# MCU PARTY
## Project for the course MICRO-210 EPFL
The project uses STK300 board equipped with Atmel® AVR® ATmega128 microcontroller [2]. Atmel Studio 7 is used as assembler, compiler and simulator for the development environment. AVRISP-U serves as a downloader.

This project is inspired from the game Wii Party (Nintendo, 2010). Three games are implemented. To win a game and earn a clue, the user must win enough rounds.

## How to play the game
We present a step by step approach.

3. Connect the STK300 kit M5 to PORT B header
4. Connect the 4x4 keypad to PORT D header as shown
on Fig. ??
5. Connect the power cable to the STK300 board
6. Turn switch on
